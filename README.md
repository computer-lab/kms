# kms (kill my slack) 

The JavaScript source in this repo contains a function: `deactivateAllMembersButAdmins`.

This function had the intended effect when pasted/executed in Chrome's browser console on Slack's "Manage members" page (`https://computer-lab.slack.com/admin`)  on 12/22/2018.

The function effectively deactivates a slack workspace, a similar function could be made to reactivate the users.

Then workspace could be toggled on / off during holidays or weekends.
